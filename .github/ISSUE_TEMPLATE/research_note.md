## Goal
What are we testing? (e.g., finetuning config, edge latency, new dataset split)

## Setup
- Dataset:  
- Model checkpoint:  
- Hyperparameters:  
- Edge device (if applicable):  

## Results
- Accuracy / F1 / mAP:  
- Latency (ms/frame):  
- Other observations:  

## Next Steps
What should be tried next?

## Artifacts
Attach logs, metrics, or plots if available.
